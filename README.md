===============
Small Telegram Bot made out of boredom to act as a Racket REPL, aims to function like a regular REPL, with the possiblity to start sandboxes for any given racket language and output images when they are produced.

Where I live
---------------
RacketBot on Telegram, send me a message!

I accept commands like /eval expr right now, may make it more telegram-friendly shortly.
Should work in group chats, since it also handles /cmd@BotName, not tested.

Config
---------------
Rename the defs.rkt.example to defs.rkt and replace bot token with your own token, changing the settings as you wish.
